    # This campaign, as originally written, had no definite time or
    # place.  There was a vague reference to "the eastern reaches of
    # the kingdom of Wesnoth".  In a later revision the epilogue hints
    # that Arvith may have traveled with the elf-lord Kalenz, but this is
    # not much of a constraint as Kalenz was around in 1YW and at
    # least until the beginning of HttT in 517 YW.
    #
    # Maghre has to be within reach of the orcs, but in a time and
    # place where there haven't been orc raids for generations. I (ESR)
    # think this limits us to *western* Wesnoth, orc raids having been a
    # chronic problem in the northeast even during the Kingdom's strongest
    # periods. The logical time would be shortly after the death of
    # Haldric IV in 350, the beginning of the First Dark Age.  I'm arbitrarily
    # setting it at 363; Kalenz began his wanderings ten years later, so the
    # timing for Arvith to meet him later in life isn't bad.  (Later moved
    # to 363 so the timing of the Epilogue. A-Red's backstory changes works
    # better.)

    # Placing the campaign is a little trickier.  Our main textual
    # clue is that there is a dense wood, said by legend to be
    # haunted, a few days' ride north.  Later, the boss's keep is said to
    # be still further north.  Neither of these directions has plot importance,
    # but they do suggest a locale for Maghre - near the Grey Woods.  The
    # battle maps exclude it from being in a featureless plain, though;
    # there are hills to the south and west.
    #
    # So let it be written, so let it be done.  See the tracking map
    # for the result.

            story=_ "Many years ago, in the western regions of Wesnoth, there was a small town named Maghre. It was a quiet place, isolated from the wars and difficulties of the great cities and kingdoms surrounding it. A wandering dark mage saw that they had become weak from years of peace. He claimed a fortress for himself in the nearby hills and began to prey on the townfsolk."

            story=_ "At first, there were only rumours of farmers gone missing or shambling creatures in the woods. But the mage grew greedier, and soon bands of hideous undead were roaming the town by night demanding gold in the name of “Mordak”. The council sent messengers to the closest keep for help, but they never returned."

            story=_ "At last, the people of Maghre realized that they would have to either fight off Mordak themselves or die trying. They appointed as their leader a man named Baran, a journeyman mage and former student at the Academy on the Isle of Alduin. Baran scrounged the town for as many weapons as the could find: bows from hunters, hoes and pruning hooks that could be beat into spears, and slings and cudgels for those who had nothing else."

Baran had made amulets for the two of them, long ago, that could call out to each other in times of need. It had been many years since Baran and Arvith, his brother, had called on each other, but now, in his greatest need, he sent out the call."

Excerpt from the journal of Baran of Maghre
I wish our people were strong enough to face Mordak now! I can't sit idly by while his servants slaughter our people in the night. But we're not ready; the townsfolk hardly know how to wield the few weapons we have for them. Arvith would know what to do, and he'd have the weapons and people to do it. I've called for him, but I don't know if he will answer. Since our falling out at Toen Caric, I haven't dared use the amulet and neither has he. But surely he'll answer, if not for my sake, then for the people of this town."
